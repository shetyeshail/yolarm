Alarm I/YO
======

You know how Yo("justyo.co") makes an annoying noise when you recieve Yo's? As it turns out, it adds enough of a human element to notifications that makes it possible to wake people up given enough yo's in a row.


Yo at "ALARMIO" to subscribe to alarm noises at a time you set on our website.

From there. When you recieve Yo's in the morning:

1. Yo once to snooze

2. Yo twice to turn off

3. Throw your phone against the wall when you grow tired of the noise
