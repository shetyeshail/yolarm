  <h1>Welcome to Alarm I/YO</h1>

  <h2>The new app, Yo, seems to have some awesome use cases</h2>

  <h3>From letting you communicate with friends in 2 taps</h3>

  <h3>To creating codes based on number of repitition of the word "Yo" (morse code)</h3>

  <h2>We're super interested in making the application work in ways that you would never think about!</h2>

  <div id="yo-button"></div>
